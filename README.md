# 🌍 Earthquake Simulation: Finding Safe Areas

## Project Overview

This project is an educational simulation game where users try to move away from earthquake risk zones and reach safe areas on the map. Players navigate through a map, collecting points while avoiding dangerous regions and seeking safe zones. The game aims to raise awareness about earthquakes and provides an engaging and interactive learning experience.

## Features

🌐 Random Earthquake Epicenter: At the start of the game, a random earthquake epicenter is determined, creating a risk zone.
🔴 Fault Lines: Major fault lines in Turkey (such as the North Anatolian Fault and East Anatolian Fault) are prominently displayed on the map to indicate earthquake risk zones.
🏡 Safe Areas: The game includes several predefined safe areas that players aim to reach. These areas are clearly marked on the map.
💰 Scoring System:
Points are lost when the player approaches a dangerous region.
Points are gained when the player reaches a safe zone.
🕹️ Movement Controls: Players can control the character's movement using on-screen buttons:
Up, Down, Left, Right
End Game button to stop the game at any time.
⏰ Timer: A countdown timer tracks the remaining time to complete the game. If time runs out, the game ends.
📱 Responsive Design: The game is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring smooth gameplay across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
🎮 Interactive Map: The game uses Leaflet.js to display the map, fault lines, safe zones, and earthquake epicenter with interactive elements.

## Gameplay Instructions

Start the Game: Press the Start Game button to begin. The game will initialize with a random earthquake epicenter, fault lines, and safe zones.
Move the Player: Use the Up, Down, Left, or Right buttons to move the player on the map. The goal is to avoid the earthquake risk zone and reach one of the safe areas.
Time Limit: You have a limited time to reach a safe zone before the timer runs out. Keep an eye on the countdown.
Scoring: Points are awarded when the player gets closer to a safe area, but points are deducted when approaching a risk zone. The closer you are to the safe area, the higher your score.
End the Game: If you reach a safe zone, the game ends with a success message and your final score. If you run out of time or hit a risk zone, the game ends with a failure message.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Used for structuring the project and creating the layout.
CSS: Styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles game logic, including movement, scoring, and timer functionality.
Leaflet.js: A powerful JavaScript library for mapping and visualizing geographic data, used for displaying the map, fault lines, earthquake epicenter, and safe zones.
Custom Icons: Used for marking fault lines and safe areas with customized icons.

## Usage

The project is designed to run in a web browser. You can start the game by opening the HTML file. Users can set a starting position and attempt to reach safe areas.
